This code creates a new password when the generate password button is clicked. When the event listener proccesses a click on the button, a chain of window.confirm/window.prompts builds a variable that contains all of the wanted characters. The password is then generated by a for loop incrementing password.length times pulling a random character from the accepted list. The password is then displayed for the user.
